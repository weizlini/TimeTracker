# Time Tracker App
This a swift Macs OS app living in the menu bar. 

## license
Open Source. Do whatever the fuck you want with it.. change it, love it, leave it, make it pink and give to your mom. credit me if you use this code for other shit. it's a nice thing to do.

## Build it and run it
download the project on your mac
- build it, and run it
- enjoy

## Data is Stored in the Desktop
To make it easy to manage your projects and the location of the exported csv files of your hours when you run it, it will automatically create a folder on the desktop.. you can change this by editing the code....

## I used ChatGPT 5.2 to make the app. 
yup! i honestly barely know swift, and in some cases chat gpt doesn't either
